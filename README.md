## Hi there 👋
- Hi, I'm Wyatt
- I'm currently studying Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I've always been interested in electronics and how they function.
- A fun fact about me is: I like buying vinyl records.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? I would like to learn how polymorphism works.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
